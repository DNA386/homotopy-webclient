## Build Instructions

This repository contains the `client` and `core` packages. Run `yarn` in the
root directory to install all dependencies and link the included packages
together. The packages can then be built individually by running `npm run
build` in their respective directory. By running `npm run dev` a package can
be continuously rebuilt upon changes to the source. Running `npm run dev` in
the client directory also starts a webserver and enables hot reloading for
development.
